     * Simplifies debts using a GREEDY two-pointer algorithm.
     *
     * The classic "minimum cash flow" problem: given a set of users with
     * positive balances (creditors - owed money) and negative balances
     * (debtors - owe money), find the minimum number of transactions
     * to settle all debts.
     *
     * Algorithm:
     * 1. Separate users into creditors (positive balance) and debtors (negative balance)
     * 2. Sort creditors by balance descending (largest creditor first)
     * 3. Sort debtors by balance ascending (most negative debtor first)
     * 4. Use two pointers: match the largest creditor with the largest debtor
     * 5. Settle the smaller of the two absolute amounts between them
     * 6. Reduce both balances accordingly; advance the pointer whose balance
     *    reaches zero
     * 7. Continue until all balances are effectively zero
     *
     * This greedy approach minimizes the number of transactions because it
     * always settles the maximum possible amount in each transaction.
